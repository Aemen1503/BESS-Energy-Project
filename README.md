# 🔋 BESS-Energy-Project

**Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Analysis using Google Colab**

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of real and synthetic datasets related to the performance of various BESS installations and solar power systems. The entire analysis is done using Python in Google Colab.

## 📊 Key Insights

- ⚡ **BESS Underutilization**: Over 88% of time spent in idle mode  
- 🔁 **Frequent short cycles**: Charging/Discharging events are sharp but brief  
- 📉 **Energy Imbalance**: Significant energy loss during charging  
- 🔥 **Evening Peak Operation**: Most BESS activity happens between 7–10 PM  
- ☀️ **Solar Plant PR & CUF**: Performance Ratio trends, efficiency drops, billing discrepancies flagged  
- 🧠 **Anomaly Detection**: IQR, rule-based, and statistical methods applied to find power spikes and idle durations
